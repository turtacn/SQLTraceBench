# Validation Report Interpretation Guide

This guide explains how to interpret the `validation_report.html` generated by SQLTraceBench after a benchmark run.

## 1. Report Overview

The report provides a comprehensive view of the benchmark results, comparing the performance of the candidate database (or configuration) against a baseline.

### Key Sections:

1.  **Status Card**: Immediate visual feedback on whether the validation passed or failed.
2.  **Performance Metrics**: Charts visualizing QPS (Queries Per Second) and Latency distributions.
3.  **Statistical Validation**: Detailed table of statistical tests performed (e.g., KS Test, Chi-Square) and their results.

## 2. Key Metrics & Interpretation

### 2.1 QPS Deviation
**Definition:** `(Actual QPS - Baseline QPS) / Baseline QPS * 100%`

**Interpretation:**
*   **Green (|Deviation| < 5%)**: Excellent match. The candidate performs similarly to the baseline.
*   **Yellow (5% ≤ |Deviation| < 15%)**: Acceptable variance. Minor tuning may be required.
*   **Red (|Deviation| ≥ 15%)**: Significant deviation. Requires investigation.

**Common Scenarios:**
*   **Negative Deviation (e.g., -20%)**: Candidate is slower. Check resource utilization (CPU, IO), index usage, or locking issues.
*   **Positive Deviation (e.g., +20%)**: Candidate is faster. While generally good, if the goal is to *replicate* behavior, this might indicate the candidate is skipping work or caching more aggressively.

### 2.2 Statistical Tests

#### KS Test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov)
**Purpose:** Checks if the latency distribution of the candidate matches the baseline.

**p-value:**
*   **p > 0.05**: PASS. No significant difference in distributions.
*   **p ≤ 0.05**: FAIL. Significant difference detected.

#### Chi-Square Test
**Purpose:** Often used to check uniformity or goodness-of-fit for categorical data or binned distributions.

## 3. Troubleshooting

**If Status is FAIL:**
1.  Check **QPS Deviation**. Is the system under too much load?
2.  Examine **Latency Charts**. Is there a long tail? Are P99 latencies spiking?
3.  Review **Error Rates**. High error rates will invalidate performance metrics.
4.  Check logs for specific query failures.

**Tips:**
*   Hover over charts to see exact values.
*   Use the "Baseline" values as your ground truth.
